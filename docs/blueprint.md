- Background color: Very light indigo (#F0F2FA). A desaturated version of the primary color creates a calming effect without being stark white, appropriate for either light or dark mode.
- Accent color: Muted cyan (#00BCD4), providing visual interest as well as indicating interactivity of certain UI elements such as buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, minimalist icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) for key functions like SOS, chat, location, and settings.
- Home Screen: Sections for Women's Safety, Emergency, and Rooms, arranged as clear, tappable cards.
- Subtle, smooth transitions between screens to create a polished feel.
